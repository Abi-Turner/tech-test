This is a React web application that allows users to search for images using keywords. The app returns images related to the search query if it is successful.

## **Built With**

This app was built with:

* React

## **Testing Utilities Used**
  
* Jest
* React Testing Library

## **Packages Used**

* Axios

## **Running the App**

To run this app on your local machine, you will need to clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm install. Once that is done, you can start the app by running npm start.

## **Future Improvements**

If I had more time, I would add:

* Pagination to the search results.
* The ability to filter search results by image type or color.
* A feature to allow users to save their favorite images.
* An option to download images directly from the search results.
