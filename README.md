# React NASA Tech Test

This is a React web application that allows users to search for images using keywords. The app retrieves and displays images related to the search query if the request is successful.

## Description

For the technical test, I was given the task to create a web application that utilises React to enable image search functionality based on keywords. The application makes use of the NASA API to retrieve relevant images.

## Built With

This app was built with the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Testing Utilities Used

To ensure the quality of the application, the following testing utilities were employed:

- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework.
- React Testing Library: A library for testing React components.

## Packages Used

The following package was utilised in the development of this application:

- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Running the App

To run this app on your local machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tech-test.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would implement the following enhancements:

- Pagination to navigate through search results.
- Filters to refine search results based on image type or colour.
- Favourite image functionality to allow users to save their preferred images.
- Download option to directly download images from the search results.
